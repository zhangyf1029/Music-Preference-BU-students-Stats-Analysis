# Music Preference among BU Students
For our project, we were trying to find the correlation between music 
preferences and five other variables, such as GPA, Major, activity, 
region and age. To test our hypothesis of each 
variable, we showed that distribution of GPA and categorize qualitative 
variables. According to our analysis, there was not much correlation 
between the time spent on listening to music and GPA. There was a 
correlation between music genre and major. The most common activity 
associated with music was leisure.

## Data Collection
